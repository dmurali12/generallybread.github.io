## Structural Components
- **Soma**: cell body
	- Information reception and integration
- **Dendrites**: made for signal reception
- **Axons**: signal transmission within the neuron
- **Axon hillock**: where axon originates from cell body
- **Axon terminal**: end of the axon; signal transmission between neurons
