#### Overview
- Function like [[Endocrine System/Peptide Hormones|peptide hormones]] or [[Endocrine System/Steroid Hormones|steroid hormones]] depending on structure and regulation
	- [[Catecholamines]] act like peptide hormones because they **bind extracellularly**
	- [[Public/Endocrine System/Thyroid Axis|Thyroid Hormones]] act like steroid hormones because they bind **intracellularly**
- Most, however, don't just diffuse through the membrane like steroid hormones do

#### Common Amino Acid Derived Hormones
- *[[Catecholamines]]*: derived from **tyrosine**
- *[[Public/Endocrine System/Thyroid Axis|Thyroid Hormones]]*: derived from **tyrosine**
- *Serotonin*: derived from **tryptophan**
