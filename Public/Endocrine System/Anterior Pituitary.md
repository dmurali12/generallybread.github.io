# Hormones

- **Corticotrophs** produce [[Public/Endocrine System/HPA Axis|Adrencocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)]]
- **Thyrotrophs** produce [[Public/Endocrine System/Thyroid Axis|Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)]] 
- **Somatotrophs** produce [[Growth Hormone (GH)]]
- **Gonadotrophs** produce [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)]] and [[Lutenizing Hormone (LH)]]
