#### Overview
- Made up of: [[Amino Acids]]
	- Is [[Polarity|polar]]
- Large precursor polypeptide is *cleaved* during [[Post-Translational Modifications]]
- Produced in the [[Cell Organization|endoplasmic reticulum]]
- Activated in the [[Cell Organization|Golgi apparatus]]
- Effects tend to be **short-lived**

#### Mechanism
- The hormone is known as the **first messenger**
	- Binds to **extracellular receptor**
		- Receptors tend to be GPCRs ([[G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)]])
- Binding triggers a second signal, known as the **second messenger**

#### Common Cascades
- [[Adenylate Cyclase Cascade]]
- [[Inositol Phosphates]]
- [[Ca2+ Cascade]]

#### Common Peptide Hormones
- [[Insulin]]
- [[Glucagon]]
