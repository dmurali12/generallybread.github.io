- Responsible for regulating ***basal metabolic rate***

TRH from hypothalamus --> TSH from ant pit --> Thyroid releases both T3 and T4 (but mostly T4)
- other organs conv T4 to T3 by deiodination

TRH acts on [[G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)|GPCRs]]
- cascade: [[Inositol Phosphates]]
TSHr also GPCR
- cascade: [[Adenylate Cyclase Cascade]]

negative feedback: [[Pancreatic Hormones|somatostatin]]
